# pyapr1

This is a Python implementation of the
[APR1 algorithm](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/apr/apr/trunk/crypto/apr_md5.c?revision=1460244&view=markup#l504)
used by the Apache web server to encrypt passwords used in HTTP Basic
Authentication and HTTP Digest Access Authentication.

Requires Python 3, but could probably be easily ported to Python 2.
